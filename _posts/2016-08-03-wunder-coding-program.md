  We work with K-12 schools in the US to help implement coding programs within
  their schools. We empower teachers to become facilitators by curating full
  lesson plans and materials for them. It's as easy as opening up your lesson
  binder and following the steps to engage your classrooms. We promote peer
  learning and self-progression. We let the programs teach your students while
  your teachers enable the process to happen. We also bring in mentors, skilled
  in coding, to mentor your students in technical difficulties and challenges.
  Most importantly, we want to partner with schools to develop a new generation
  of innovators.
